# Reimplmenting Lodash functional library Part 1

## Tests

To run the tests made for these functions:
    - clone this repository
    - run npm intall in the command line
    - run npm test in the command line

## Challenge

The Lodash functional library Sprint involves reimplementing a JS library as if you were its author. For Part 1 of this sprint, reimplement the following methods:

## Core

These are the core functions to get finished;

1. identity
2. first
3. last
4. each
5. indexOf
6. filter
7. reject
8. uniq
9. map
10. contains

## Resources:

1. [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
2. [The Mocha Test Framework](https://mochajs.org/)
3. [The Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/)

## Advanced

These are a little harder but will be very beneficial to try and complete.

1. pluck
2. reduce
3. every
4. some
5. extends
6. defaults


# Lodash functional library Part 2 (more advanced)
## Tasks

1. once
2. memoize
3. shuffle
4. invoke
5. sortBy (NB the Underscore library uses the native JavaScript sort but feel free to use your sort algorithm!)
6. zip
7. sortedIndex
8. flatten
9. intersection
10. difference

# Advanced

11. indexOf (again, this time with a binary search)
12. throttle
13. delay

## Resources:

1. [The Mocha Test Framework](https://mochajs.org/)
2. [The Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/)
3. [Sinon - spies, stubs & mocks](http://sinonjs.org/)
4. [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
